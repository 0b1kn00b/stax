# Introduction
The Funk library examples:

1. Run ``` haxe examples.hxml ``` (Note: this will pull down a patched version of xirsys_stdjs which will examples will compile against. This will remove any xirsys_stdjs haxelib libs you have installed.)
2. Run ``` haxe canvas-examples.hxml ``` to compile the canvas version of the examples.
3. Open up the bin folder and run the html/swf files in the correct folder.
