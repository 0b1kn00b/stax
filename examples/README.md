# Introduction
The Funk library examples:

Examples are first split into view platforms (canvas, dom, flash, webgl, etc) and should be fairly similar to each other.

More explanation can be found [here](https://github.com/SimonRichardson/funk/wiki/Collections).

## Run:

1. Run ``` haxe canvas-examples.hxml ``` to compile the canvas version of the examples (same for dom, swf, etc).
2. Open up the bin folder in the root directory and run the canvas/dom/swfs in the folder.

Enjoy.
